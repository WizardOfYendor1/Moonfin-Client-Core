// stands up a graphics context and a render target that the CORE draws into,
// which inverts the software path: there, the core hands back a CPU
// framebuffer the host converts and the platform blits. Here no CPU frame ever
// exists - the core renders on the GPU and video_refresh only says "done".
//
// DELIBERATELY CONTEXT-AGNOSTIC. No EGL, GL, Vulkan, Metal or CoreVideo type
// appears anywhere below, exactly as ANativeWindow already stays in the
// Android layer rather than in this header. Every platform's frame sink is a
// Flutter external texture - Android hands over a Surface/BufferQueue while
// the other four hand over a pixel buffer - so an interface shaped around any
// one platform's context API would not fit the other four.
//
// Registering a backend does NOT by itself enable hardware rendering. The
// core has to ask for it (RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_SET_HW_RENDER) and the backend has
// to agree (supports). Until both happen, lh_hw_active stays 0 and the entire
// software path runs exactly as it does with no backend registered at all.

// Bumped whenever lh_hw_backend gains or changes a field. A backend stamps the
// version it was compiled against; lh_set_hw_backend refuses anything it does
// not recognise, rather than reading past the end of an older struct.
//
// This is the seam a Vulkan backend arrives through. Vulkan's model is not a
// variation on GL's - the core receives a device from the frontend and hands
// back an image, so there is no framebuffer name anywhere in it. Version 2
// would append the negotiation and image-handoff entry points; a version-1
